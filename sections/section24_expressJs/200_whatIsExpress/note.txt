is js framework, allow us to build backend applications 

node.js is comperhinsive , (do many things), it is suitable for back end web developemnt 
    and other applicaitons like IoT , disktop apps 

but we specialise in (website backend), so we use express js 

express + node is better than node : 
    readability 
    less code 
    middleware
